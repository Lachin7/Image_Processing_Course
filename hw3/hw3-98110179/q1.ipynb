    "I start by resizing the image to the half of the previous size.\n",
    "Then I continue by blurring to make it more consistent and have less amount of noise in the image.\n",
    "I used canny edge detection method to store the edges in the edge array. In order to find the equivalent coefficients in hough space,\n",
    "I used the range [0, 360) with steps of 2 degree for theta and also an array in size of the diagonal diameter in image for rho.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Then I continued by calculating rho for each white pixel(which indicates that it is on a line) and each theta. This results in all lines passing though this point and when I find this line, I increment the value in the index of [rho, theta] in the Accumulator.\n",
    "If an index has a high value, we can conclude that there are reasonable amount of points on it and hence it is a line.\n",
    "Next I set a threshold to find all of these lines. however, some of the lines are somehow the same or they do not belong to the chessboard.\n",
    "So the next step was to remove these lines."
